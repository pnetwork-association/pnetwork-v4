# XERC20 EOS contracts

## Requisites:

- [EOSIO CDT v1.8.1](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/releases/tag/v1.8.1)

## Local testing

The first time, replay all the steps performed by the `test.sh`
script located at the workspace root. Then run

```
yarn test
```

The following times you would be enough to just run nodeos in the background
as done in the `test.sh` script.
